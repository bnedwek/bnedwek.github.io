## About the Quadra 700

The Quadra 700 is one of the first two Macs in the Quadra line, introduced in 1991 and using the Motorola 68040 processor.

My particular machine arrived with a 1GB hard drive containing an OS 8 installation, 20MB RAM, and a Radius video out board (but not the necessary breakout box to use it). The machine appears to have been owned by a designer and still had some documents, InDesign, etc. on the hard drive.

Full specs of this Mac can be found [here](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_quadra/specs/mac_quadra_700.html).

## Plans for this machine

- Install [Apple A/UX](http://aux-penelope.com/)
- Some vintage gaming (F/A-18 Hornet)
- Software dev
- Maybe some MIDI stuff?
